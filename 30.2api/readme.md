 API’s
Instructions
Lets create a small movie app.
We will be using the omdb api.
We need to register for an api key here.
You will get an email with your unique api key.
Read the documentation on what you can do with this api.
To have some influence look here
We want a user to type a movie name in an input and get
the following data displayed on the screen:

1. Movie poster
2. Movie title
3. Genre
4. Year
5. Plot
6. Director
7. Actors
8. Ratings of movies from imdb, rotten tomatoes and
   metacritic.
   (make sure that particular movie gives you all the ratings.
   It could be, that movie won’t give you all 3 ratings)
   Each time a user searches for a new movie remove the old
   movie from the screen.
   Extra:
   There is so much more you can do with the API. Research
   what more things you can do with it in the documentation.
