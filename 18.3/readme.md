 the dom
Instructions
You have these elements in your html file:

<div id="myFirstDiv"></div>
<div id="mySecondDiv"></div>
<div id="myThridDiv"></div>
<div id="myFourthDiv"></div>
Somebody selected the elements and stored them into
individual variables like this:

const myFirstDiv = document.querySelector("#myFirstDiv");
const mySecondDiv = document.querySelector("#mySecondDiv");
const myThirdDiv = document.querySelector("#myThirdDiv");
const myFourthDiv = document.querySelector("#myFourthDiv");

Is there a better way you can store the individual elements
with giving them different names?
