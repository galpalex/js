Website Building: API’s
JS – Github API
The following exercise contains the following subjects:
 API’s
Instructions
Github has an awesome API that we can do among other
thing’s, is to get information on a particular user.
To get a particular github user information just type in your
browser the following:
https://api.github.com/users/{username}
You will get back a json object.
With this knowledge we can make a fun little app.
Here is a small demo what we should do.
Please style it better than this!
Lets create a small app that will have an input field. When
you type a user’s name in the input field you will fetch from
the github api that particular users information and display
a card of the users information.
That card should have at least the following:

1. Avatar image
2. Name of user
3. Number of public repo’s
   When a user clicks on the card it will open a new page to
   that users github profile page.
   Things to think about:
   What will happen if a user types an invalid user name?
   What happens if the url is broken?
   What happens if a user types the same user name? We
   wouldn’t want to have duplicate cards of the same profile.
   User experience
   What will make a better user experience? Things come into
   mind:
4. When a user gets a profile we should empty our input.
5. We should focus on the input on page load and each
   time you get a new profile.
6. We should able to hit enter to search not just clicking on
   the button.
7. Anything else?
